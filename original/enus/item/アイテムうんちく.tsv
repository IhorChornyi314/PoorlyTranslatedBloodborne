2070	Tonitrus is a unique weapon crafted by Archibald,/the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop.//This is a similar morning star mace that utilizes/Quicksilver Bullets. When struck into the ground,/it recreates the blue sparks that are said to surround/the darkbeasts. //Like Archibald's masterpiece, this too/is a superb conductor of the powerful blue sparks.

2090	A blade of bone coated with gruesome spinal fluid./Used by old labyrinth Watchers, in particular, those presiding over rituals.//When a victim is cut by this blade, the green spinal fluid temporarily numbs the senses, disturbing the target's gross motor skills. The blade, never intended for battle, must cut deep to be effective, and breaks.
2110	A strange gift from the messengers, inhabitants of/the dream who revere the brave hunters.//Use to envelop oneself in a black nightmarish mist,/then transform into a messenger. The illusion is a parlor/trick, and any large movement will break the spell.//To preserve the guise, proceed very slowly.

4009	Of the three great bridges that link the two/cathedral cradles, this key opens the iron door/that leads to the midlevel bridge.//There are no thieves in the nightmare. Then,/why lock a door? Be warned, there must be a very,/very good reason.
4010	The key to the Upper Cathedral Ward seal.//The upper echelons of the Healing Church are formed/by the School of Mensis, based in the Unseen Village,/and the Choir occupying the Upper Cathedral Ward.//This key brings one a step closer to the Choir.
4011	A cloth emblem that belonged to the captain of the/Church hunters long ago. Opens the main gate that/leads to the round plaza of the Great Cathedral.//The main gate is shut tight on nights of the hunt,/and could only be opened from the other side with/this emblem. In other words, the captain's return,/and this emblem, determined the end of the hunt.
4012	Key to the Lecture Theatre in the Lecture Building.//Today, the two-story Lecture Building is adrift in the nightmare, but once it was a place of reflection, where scholars learned of history and archaeology.//Perhaps it still is, as the students in the lecture theatre appear to await the return of their professor.
4013	Key to the lunarium facing the lake on the second floor of Byrgenwerth College.//In his final years, Master Willem was fond of the lookout, and the rocking chair that he kept there for meditation.//In the end, it is said, he left his secret with the lake.
4014	Skull of Laurence, first vicar of the Healing Church./In reality he became the first cleric beast, and his human skull only exists within the Nightmare.//The skull is a symbol of Laurence's past, and what he failed to protect. He is destined to seek his skull, but even if he found it, it could never restore his memories.
4015	Key to the inner chamber of the cell below the Grand Cathedral.//The innermost chamber of the underground cell holds a lone madman. He wears a beast hide, and rings a bell that emits no sound.//Unending death awaits those who can hear the soundless bell.
4016	
4017	An eye pendant which unlocks the surgery altar.//There are two cathedrals in the Hunter's Dream. One lies past the River of Blood, and another contains the private research hall of the Healing Church.//Only chosen members of the Healing Church, or their lamentable patients, can enter the research hall, using this eye.//Grant eyes to the surgery altar skull.
4018	Key to the cell below the Grand Cathedral.//Hunters are held within the underground cell, so that things better left unseen, and knowledge better left unknown, will decay quietly in the fallow darkness.
4019	Key to the balcony on the first floor of the Research Hall.//Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower gave this to the patient, Adeline./Maria had hoped Adeline would find comfort in the faint breeze that carried the scent of flowers from the outside, but Adeline couldn't fathom her intentions.
4020	Key to the Astral Clocktower at the top of the Grand Cathedral.//The caretaker of the tower's numerous patients, known to them only as Lady Maria, made her home behind the giant star-interpreting clock.

4102	A misplaced workshop tool from the Hunter's Dream.//The hunter who retrieves this can extract Arcane Haze/from ritual materials.//But alas, spent materials are lost.
4103	A misplaced workshop tool from the Hunter's Dream.//The hunter who retrieves this can fortify weapons by/kneading blood gems into them.//Blood gems add properties to weapons when used to/fortify them, as blood defines an organism.
4104	Runesmith Caryll, student of Byrgenwerth,/transcribed the inhuman utterings of the Great Ones/into what are now called Caryll Runes.//The hunter who retrieves this workshop tool can etch/Caryll Runes into the mind to attain their wondrous /strength.//Provost Willem would have been proud of Caryll's runes,/as they do not rely upon blood in any measure. 
4105	One of the root chalices that breaks various seals in the Old Labyrinth.//The glass chalice, when full, is used in a short ritual to quickly create and join a Chalice Dungeon (not for use in a ritual using standard materials).//Short rituals are conducted at the makeshift altar.

4110	Badge crafted long ago at the Workshop./Attests to one's prowess as a hunter of beasts.//The Workshop is gone, and no group recognizes/this meaningless badge, except the messengers/in the bath, who understand its profundity.//Certain things can only be entrusted with a hunter/in possession of this badge, or so they believe.
4111	Badge of a Hunter of Hunters, who hunts those who have become addled with blood.//The badge of the Hunter of Hunters is quietly passed down from generation to generation, usually to an outsider from the hinterlands.//To be entrusted with this cursed badge, one must be strong, resilient to the seduction of blood, and gracious when taking a comrade's life.
4112	Badge crafted by the Powder Kegs,/the heretics of the Workshop.//The Powder Kegs adoration of complex design and/big booms culminated in weapon designs that/contrast with those traditionally of the Workshop.//The late Powder Kegs, bless their souls, had a motto:/"If a weapon ain't got kick, it just ain't worth it."
4113	This hunter's badge, crafted in Gehrman's time,/has no practical purpose, except perhaps to/assist in romanticizing about the past.//The badge was a special privilege for the hunters/of the past, and should not be dishonored.//It should be left in peace, unless one is truly/prepared to assume the will of those gone before.
4114	One of the badges crafted by the Healing Church./The silver sword is a symbol of a Church hunter.//Ludwig was the first of many Healing Church hunters/to come, many of whom were clerics. As it was,/clerics transformed into the most hideous beasts.
4115	One of the badges crafted by the Healing Church.//The radiant sword indicates the heirs to the will of Ludwig.//These hunters, also known as Holy Blades, are what remains of an ancient line of heroes that date back to a very early age of honor and chivalry.
4116	Martyr Logarius led a band of Executioners, and this badge was crafted at their dedicated workshop. The wheel symbolizes righteous destiny.//Their workshop was a secretive enclave of mystical beliefs and heady fanaticism which served as the backbone of the Executioners' unique brand of justice.
4117	Badge of the royal guards of Cainhurst, loyal guardians of the Vileblood Queen Annalise.//The Vilebloods are hunters of blood, and hunt prey as they search for blood dregs. The hunter who joins them is faced with a decision: to merely borrow their strength, or to become one of them, heart and soul.
4118	Badge crafted in secret by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church, for his friends.//Archibald was fascinated by the blue sparks that emanate from the hides of the darkbeasts, and dedicated his life to its artificial reproduction, in a style of inquiry that, incidentally, closely followed the methodology of Byrgenwerth.
4119	Badge of a member of the Choir, elites of the/Healing Church.//The eye signifies the very cosmos.//The Choir stumbled upon an epiphany, very suddenly/and quite by accident. Here we stand, feet planted in/the earth, but might the cosmos be very near us, only/just above our heads?
4120	Badge crafted by the Oto Workshop, precursor to the workshop of the heretical Powder Kegs.//The Powder Kegs were driven by singular ideas, and crafted strange weapons of great intricacy./It is clear that the philosophy of the Powder Kegs was already established at this time.

4300	A small, very ordinary hair ornament.//Although it has been lost for quite some time,/one can still see signs of the care with which/this tasteful ornament was once kept.//Its color would stand out most brilliantly against/a head of grayish hair.
4301	Silver-shining tear stone.//Use to change into a droplet blood gem/that fortifies any weapon.//A doll sheds neither blood nor tears, and thus its/nature remains unknown. Whoever thinks this is/precious must be troubled by severe naiveté.

4304	The inhuman beings known as the Great Ones imbued this ring of betrothal with some special meaning.//In the age of the Great Ones, wedlock was a blood contract, only permitted to those slated to bear a special child.

4306	A woman's bright-red brooch, engraved with the name Viola.//Perhaps the jewel is a gift from a hunter. Use to change into a droplet blood gem that fortifies any weapon.//With the proper workshop tool, various weapons can be fortified.
4307	*
4308	An old, sealed summons.//Like the first of its kind, it is an invitation to Cainhurst, but for whom is not known, as it lacks an addressee.
4309	*
4310	A latticed, deformed rock, or perhaps a meteorite.//Appears useless, but possesses some odd gravitational force that prevents its riddance. A dubious soul once said://"Step lightly round to the right of the great cathedral, and seek an ancient, shrouded church... The gift of the godhead will grant you strength..."
4311	The eye of a blood-drunk hunter. Its pupil is collapsed and turned to mush, indicating the onset of the scourge of beasts.//A hunter who goes drunk with blood is said to be taken by the Nightmare, destined to wander forever, engaged in an endless hunt. It is a fate that no hunter can escape.
4312	One of the resonating bells that cross the gaps of worlds./This bell is cracked and stained with the blood of beasts.//A human must expend Insight to ring this uncanny bell.//The old hunters, who have long passed from the dream but cannot forget the feeling of the hunt, rely upon messengers to relay their thoughts./Ring the bell at their side, and they are certain to give a listen./For the night of the hunt is long, and unchanging.

4321	A great relic, also known as the Cord of the Eye. Every infant Great One has this precursor to the umbilical cord.//Every Great One loses its child, and then yearns for a surrogate, and Oedon, the formless Great One, is no different. To think, it was corrupted blood that began this eldritch liaison.//Use to gain Insight and, so they say, eyes on the inside, although no one remembers what that truly entails.
4322	A great relic, also known as the Cord of the Eye. Every infant Great One has this precursor to the umbilical cord.//Provost Willem sought the Cord in order to elevate his being and thoughts to those of a Great One, by lining his brain with eyes. The only choice, he knew, if man were to ever match Their greatness.
4323	A great relic, also known as the Cord of the Eye. Every infant Great One has this precursor to the umbilical cord.//Every Great One loses its child, and then yearns for a surrogate.

In the end, this led to their encounter with the Eldritch Truth, for which they considered themselves blessed.
4341	Greyish amoeba-shaped brain fluid. Wobbles and bounces.//Extracted from a patient whose head expanded until that was all that they were.//In the early days of the Healing Church, the Great Ones were linked to the ocean, and so the cerebral patients would imbibe water, and listen for the howl of the sea./Brain fluid writhed inside the head, the initial makings of internal eyes.
4342	Greyish amoeba-shaped brain fluid. Wobbles and bounces.//Extracted from a patient whose head expanded until that was all that they were.//We fail to realize our own latent potential, until the moment it is lost, and we sense its absence. Ironically, this is the very nature of insight, like the moment one licks one's own blood, only to be startled by its sweetness.
4900	Hat that messengers are oddly fond of./Commonly called a Yharnam hat.//The inhabitants of the stump appear to/have an interest in adornment. Why not/let them be happy, and revel as babes?

4908	Accessory adored by naïve messengers./The messengers wear the urns, filled with incense/that wards off beasts, on their heads upside-down,/suggesting a predilection to the dark.//The inhabitants of the stump appear to have an /interest in adornment.
